              Hello World! My name is Andrew Lee and I am currently 23 years old. I graduated from the University of
              California, Riverside in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering.

              I am currently studying to become a web developer because I have always been intrigued with the process of
              building and creating. I hope one day I can combine my knowledge of web development with engineering.
              Some of my favorite pastimes are making music, gaming with friends, and watching a good movie.
